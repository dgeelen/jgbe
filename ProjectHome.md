# JGBE - Java GameBoy Emulator #

An emulator for the GameBoy/GameBoy Color written in Java.

### Latest Release ###
We've made a new beta release, v752-b1. It's fully packed with all kinds of neat features:
  * Emulation correctness improved A LOT
    * Passes ``Demotronic Final'' demo emulator detection (It cannot distinguish JGBE from actual GameBoy hardware).
    * Many games now work correctly (smurf 1, mario 2, batman, etc etc)
  * Fullscreen mode
  * Interpolation so you can make your window any size
  * Recording and playing back of game sessions
  * Rotating save states with "Save To Oldest State" option
  * Advanced color selection dialog for choosing your custom palletes
  * Advanced sound setting dialog to tweak java into submission
  * (almost) All settings are now saved

### Features ###
  * Smart video scaling up to 4x size
  * Seperate Custom Palletes for Background/Sprites for mono games
  * Up to 10 save states per game
  * Link capability over TCP/IP (and locally)
  * Advanced Disassembler/Debugger with lots of options
  * And many more...
